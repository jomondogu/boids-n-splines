# CSc 473/578C - Fall 2018 Labs

In this site you will find all of the lab materials. Note the following:

* The labs use CMake, as well as a modified version of the Atlas framework available [here](https://github.com/marovira/atlas)
* The labs are written in C++. This is due to simplicity, but you are not required to use it in your assignments.
